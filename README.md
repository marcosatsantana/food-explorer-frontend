## üìù About

Food Explorer is a comprehensive web platform for a restaurant, providing users with a complete ordering and tracking experience. With features for registration, order creation, and status tracking, users can easily make and monitor their choices. Profile customization, favorite filtering, and search functions help enhance the convenience and personalization of the experience for each user.

The fully functional shopping cart enables users to select desired items and choose between two payment methods: card or Pix (a popular Brazilian electronic payment method). This flexibility makes it more convenient for customers to make payments.

The Administrator role is crucial for the platform, as they have the ability to manage the restaurant's menu by adding, editing, and removing dishes as needed. Additionally, the administrator can update order statuses to reflect the kitchen's preparation process, and these updates are immediately visible to consumers.

The project also includes additional features such as the option to change the page theme, allowing users to customize the platform's appearance according to their preferences. Furthermore, user profile personalization, including image, name, and password, enables a more individualized experience.

The project showcases various visual effects, which can make the platform more appealing and engaging for users.

Finally, Food Explorer's responsive adaptation to different types of devices is a crucial feature, allowing users to conveniently access and use the platform on smartphones, tablets, and computers.

Overall, Food Explorer is a comprehensive and well-designed web platform, providing users with a complete experience of ordering, tracking, and customization.</p>
